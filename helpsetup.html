Note: If using the PPPoE option, you will need to ensure that
any PPPoE client software on your computers is removed or

</dt><dd>Used when your ISP provides you a set IPv6 address that

<dt>DHCPv6 Mode
</dt><dd>A method of connection where the ISP assigns your IPv6

<dl>
<dt>PPPoE
</dt><dd>Select this option if your ISP requires you to use a
PPPoE (Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet) connection

<dt>WEP
<dd>
<p>A method of encrypting data for wireless communication intended to provide the same level of privacy as a wired network. WEP is not as secure as WPA encryption.
To gain access to a WEP network, you must know the key.
The key is a string of characters that you create. When using WEP, you must determine the level of encryption.
The type of encryption determines the key length. 128-bit encryption requires a longer key than 64-bit encryption.
Keys are defined by entering in a string in HEX (hexadecimal - using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange - alphanumeric characters) format.
ASCII format is provided so you can enter a string that is easier to remember. The ASCII string is converted to HEX for use over the network.
Four keys can be defined so that you can change keys easily.To set WEP key,please click <span class=button_ref>Set WEP Key</span></p>
<DIV class=help_example>
<dl>
<dt>Example:
<dd>64-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 10 characters in length. (12345678FA is a valid string of 10 characters for 64-bit encryption.)
<dd>128-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 26 characters in length. (456FBCDF123400122225271730 is a valid string of 26 characters for 128-bit encryption.)
<dd>64-bit ASCII keys are up to 5 characters in length (DMODE is a valid string of 5 characters for 64-bit encryption.)
<dd>128-bit ASCII keys are up to 13 characters in length (2002HALOSWIN1 is a valid string of 13 characters for 128-bit encryption.)

<dl>
<dt>LAN Setup
<dd>These are the settings of the LAN (Local Area Network)
interface for the router. The router's local network (LAN)
settings are configured based on the IP Address and Subnet Mask
assigned in this section. The IP address is also used to access
this Web-based management interface. It is
recommended that you use the default settings if you do not have
an existing network.
<dt>IP Address
<dd>The IP address of your router on the local area network.
Your local area network settings are based on the address
assigned here. For example, 192.168.0.1.
<dt>Subnet Mask
<dd>The subnet mask of your router on the local area network.
<dt>DHCP Server Settings
<dd>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. The DHCP section is where you
configure the built-in DHCP Server to assign IP addresses to the computers and other
devices on your local area network (LAN).
<dl>
<dt>DHCP Mode
<dd>
<p>Once your D-Link router is properly configured and select "DHCP Server"
option, the DHCP Server will manage the IP addresses
and other network configuration information for computers and
other devices connected to your Local Area Network. There is no
need for you to do this yourself. </p>
<p>The computers (and other devices) connected to your LAN also
need to have their TCP/IP configuration set to "DHCP" or "Obtain
an IP address automatically". </p>
<dt>IP Pool Range
<dd>These two IP values define a
range of IP addresses that the DHCP Server uses when assigning
addresses to computers and devices on your Local Area Network.
Any addresses that are outside of this range are not managed by
the DHCP Server; these could, therefore, be used for manually
configured devices or devices that cannot use DHCP to obtain
network address details automatically.
<p>Your D-Link router, by default, has a static IP address of
192.168.1.1. This means that addresses 192.168.1.2 to
192.168.1.254 can be made available for allocation by the DHCP
Server. </p>
<DIV class=help_example>
<dl>
<dt>Example:
<dd>Your D-Link router uses 192.168.1.1 for the IP address.
You've assigned a computer that you want to designate as a Web
server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.3. You've
assigned another computer that you want to designate as an FTP
server with a static IP address of 192.168.1.4. Therefore the
starting IP address for your DHCP IP address range needs to be
192.168.1.5 or greater.
<dt>Example:
<dd>Suppose you configure the DHCP Server to manage addresses
From 192.168.1.100 To 192.168.1.199. This means that
192.168.1.3 to 192.168.1.99 and 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.254
are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that
use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured.
</dd>
</dl>
</DIV>
<dt>Max Lease Time
<dd>The amount of time that a computer may have an IP address
before it is required to renew the lease. The lease functions
just as a lease on an apartment would. The initial lease
designates the amount of time before the lease expires. If the
tenant wishes to retain the address when the lease is expired
then a new lease is established. If the lease expires and the
address is no longer needed then another tenant may use the
address.
