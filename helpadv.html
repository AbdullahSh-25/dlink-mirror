<td class=content>
<p>Port Triggering is a special form of Port Forwarding in which it requires an outgoing connection
before allowing incoming connections on a single or multiple port. Port Triggering is mostly used when
your computer is behind a NAT router.</p> <p>For example, if a gaming application
sends outgoing data on ports 5000-6000 but receives the incoming data on port 111, typically behind a NAT
router the router simply drops the data because it does not know which computer it should send requests to.
But with port triggering you can tell the router to allow incoming data on port 111 when an outgoing data sends
it through ports 5000-6000. It gives more flexibility than static port forwarding because you don't need
to set it up for a specific computer.</p>

<p>Multiple connections are required by some applications, such as internet games, video conferencing,

Translation). This section is used to open multiple ports or a range of ports in your router and redirect
data through those ports to a single PC on your network.</p>

<dl>
<dt>DMZ Host
<dd>
<p>DMZ means "Demilitarized Zone." If an application has trouble
working from behind the router, you can expose one computer to the
Internet and run the application on that computer. </p>
<p>When a LAN host is configured as a DMZ host, it becomes the
destination for all incoming packets that do not match some other
incoming session or rule. If any other ingress rule is in place,
that will be used instead of sending packets to the DMZ host; so,
an active session, virtual server, active port trigger, or port
forwarding rule will take priority over sending a packet to the
DMZ host. (The DMZ policy resembles a default port forwarding rule
that forwards every port that is not specifically sent anywhere
else.) </p>
<dd>
<p><B>Note:</B> Putting a computer in the DMZ may expose that
computer to a variety of security risks. Use of this option is
only recommended as a last resort. </p>
<dl>
<dt>DMZ Host IP Address
<dd>Specify the LAN IP address of the LAN computer that you want to have unrestricted Internet communication. If this computer obtains its address Automatically using DHCP,
then you may want to make a static reservation on the <a href="dhcpip_nocheck_lanip.html">Setup-->Local Network-->DHCP Reserved</a> page so that the IP address of the DMZ computer does not change.

<dt>IP/Port Filter
<dd>
<p>When you use the Port Triggering or Port Forwarding features to open specific ports to traffic from the
Internet, you could be increasing the exposure of your LAN to cyberattacks from the Internet.
In these cases, you can limit that exposure by specifying the IP addresses of Internet
hosts that you trust to access your LAN through the ports that you have opened. You might, for example, only
allow access to a game server on your home LAN from the computers of friends whom you have invited to play
the games on that server.</p>
<p>Downstream filter can be used for limiting access to a server on your network to a system or group of systems.
</p>
<p>Upstream filter can be used to limit LAN computer from accessing the Internet.
Upstream filter can be used in conjunction with the Downstream filter to allow incoming
and restrict outgoing access when playing a game over the Internet or simply downloading a file.</p>
<dt>IPv6/Port Filter
<dd>Restrict certain types of ipv6 data packets between LAN-side and WAN-side.
<dt>MAC Filter
